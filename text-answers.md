Do you think the predicted tags "PRON AUX AUX NOUN PUNCT" for the sentence "They can can fish ." are correct? Use your understanding of parts-of-speech from the notes.

Ans:
Because the second 'can' is a verb 'to can fish', also first 'can' explains the ability of 'they' to 'can fish'. Therefore, it should be "PRON AUX VERB NOUN PUNCT".
